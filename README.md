# Vendetta

This game was intoduced twice on Google Play market and both times it was banned. The users in the game are being devided by teams and start hunting each other. Bluetooth is used to approve the shots. Each 15 minutes hunter has an aproximate position of a victim. Each player is a vicitm of some other. If Victim "dies" his victim rolls to the hunter that caught him.

This game has passed all the tests in real world but never was popular.
